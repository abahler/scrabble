 *
 * 	Pseudocode for an online version of Scrabble
 * 
 *  BACKGROUND:
 *  The board is made of 225 tiles (15 both horizontally and vertically).  
 *  There can only be 2 players (at least initially). 
 *
 *  FUTURE ITERATIONS:
 *  After the basic game is built, future releases will feature the familiar double-word, triple-word,
 *    double-letter and triple-letter score cells that compound the points for one turn.
 * 	
 * 	Further out, it would be great to create a computerized player for one-player games.

1. Player A, having seven letters, plays a word.
	- If this is the first play of the game:
		>> Player A must include the middle tile (G7).
	  Else:
	  	>> Player A must play off of at least one letter that has already been played.

2. Player A hits 'Submit' to submit the play.

3. Script grabs the letters and determines the word
	- words are either vertical (taking up cells like 'A2', 'B2', 'C2', 'D2') or horizontal (taking up cells like 'A2', 'A3', 'A4', 'A5')
	- the program gets all recently added letters ("recently added" meaning in the current player's turn) and sorts them by cell number, then joins them together to form a word.
	So as an example, ['r', 'o', 's', 'e'] becomes 'rose'

4. Player B opts to accept the word, or challenge its status as a legitimate common word per the rules of Scrabble.

5. if Player B accepts the word:
		- Player A's score increases with the point value for each letter in the played word.
		- Control goes to player B, program goes back to step 1
	else:	
		- Player B challenges the word
		-  program sends word to API, evaluates result `isWord`.
		// Remember to accommodate possibility that 'true' and 'false' will be strings
		- if isWord == true:
				player B loses a turn. 
		   else:
				player A loses a turn. it is now player B's turn.
